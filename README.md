##DreamWeave: A WebAR & AI-Driven Career Simulation Platform for Realistic Career Decision-Making

#1.	Problem Statement (Open Innovation)
Students across India make career decisions with limited exposure to the realities of different professions. Existing aptitude tests and counseling tools provide information, but lack immersive experience, real-world context, and personalized future projections. This leads to career mismatch, wrong course selection, dissatisfaction, and misalignment between student capabilities and industry needs. There is a need for a modern, experiential, data-driven career discovery system that allows students to see, feel, and understand job roles before committing to a path.

#2.	Proposed Solution: DreamWeave
DreamWeave is a WebAR + AI-based Career Reality System that allows students to explore job roles through immersive AR simulations and receive personalized, data-driven career projections. Using only a smartphone, students can preview workplace environments such as engineering labs, hospital setups, design studios, cockpit controls, etc. and understand daily responsibilities through visual AR overlays. A lightweight ML engine evaluates interests, personality traits, and skill tendencies to generate a personalized Career Fit Map.
The platform also provides a Future Insight Dashboard, predicting factors like growth trajectory, stress alignment, salary bands, required skills, and satisfaction probability based on curated datasets. This helps students make decisions rooted in clarity rather than guesswork.
DreamWeave empowers students to make informed, confident decisions, reduces the risk of career mismatch, and strengthens the alignment between student choices and industry needs. At scale, it can modernize career counseling across educational institutions nationwide.

#3.	Proposed Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
WebAR Layer: AR.js / model-viewer (GLB rendering)
Backend: Node.js / FastAPI
Database + Auth: Firebase / Supabase
ML Engine: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
This stack is chosen for speed, stability, and easy cross-device access.
