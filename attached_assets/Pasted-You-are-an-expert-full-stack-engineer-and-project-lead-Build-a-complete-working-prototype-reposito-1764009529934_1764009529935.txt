You are an expert full-stack engineer and project lead. Build a complete, working prototype repository for "DreamWave: A WebAR & AI-Driven Career Simulation Platform" (brief is in the file at /mnt/data/DreamWave Abstract.pdf — please read it first). Deliverables must be push-ready to a git repo and deployable. Follow these constraints and produce everything listed below.

GOALS (priority order)
1. A minimal, fully working web prototype (hosted) that runs the core loop:
   - Quick 6-question quiz (rule-based scoring).
   - InsightCard showing recommended career, score, salary/growth/stress estimates.
   - WebAR preview via <model-viewer> using a GLB file in `public/models/`.
   - A downloadable one-page Insight PDF (client-side generation is fine).
2. Backend API endpoints (Node/Express or FastAPI) to:
   - Serve the insight/download request (generate PDF server-side if preferred).
   - Provide an optional ML inference endpoint (if included, accept quiz answers and return career probabilities). This can be a deterministic rule-based service initially.
   - Authentication via Firebase Auth (email link or anonymous).
3. Hosting & deployment:
   - Frontend: Vercel or Firebase Hosting (prefer Vercel for easiest CI).
   - Backend: Vercel Serverless Functions or Firebase Cloud Functions. If Flames cannot deploy, produce full deployment instructions and a deployable build.
4. CI/CD:
   - GitHub Actions workflow that builds, tests (basic checks), and deploys frontend and server.
5. Documentation and assets:
   - README with how to run locally, how to deploy, environment vars required.
   - Include a small demo fallback video at `public/demo_fallback.mp4`.
   - Include at least one lightweight GLB in `public/models/ux_tools.glb` (pick a free model). If licensing requires, include link and instructions to download.

REPOSITORY STRUCTURE (exact)
- / (root)
  - README.md
  - package.json
  - .gitignore
  - /frontend
    - Vite React app (src/, public/)
  - /backend
    - server code (Node/Express or FastAPI)
  - /infra
    - github-actions workflow YAML
    - firebase.json (if using Firebase)
  - /assets
    - /models/*.glb (include placeholder file)
    - demo_fallback.mp4 (placeholder)

SPECIFIC TECH STACK (must follow)
- Frontend: React (Vite), plain CSS, uses `<model-viewer>` for WebAR: import via unpkg or NPM `@google/model-viewer`.
- Backend: Node.js + Express (or FastAPI if preferred) with endpoints:
  - `POST /api/match` — accepts quiz answers, returns career match + raw scores.
  - `POST /api/report` — accepts result, returns PDF (or pre-generated PDF URL).
- Auth & DB: Firebase Auth (email or anonymous) + Firestore / Supabase optional for saving anonymous usage events.
- ML: For Round-2 demo, a rule-based matching engine is acceptable. If you add TF.js model, include training script and model.json in repo.

SECURITY & CONFIG
- Use environment variables for secrets (`.env.example` in repo).
- Never embed real Firebase service account keys into repo. Instead output exactly how to add them to GitHub secrets.

DEVELOPMENT STEPS & COMMANDS (exact to run)
1. Initialize git repo and create work branches:
   - `git init`
   - `git checkout -b main`
2. Frontend scaffold (inside /frontend):
   - `npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react`
   - `cd frontend`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm install @google/model-viewer`
3. Add provided React components (Quiz, InsightCard, ARPreview) in `/frontend/src/components` following the sample in the task brief.
4. Backend scaffold (inside /backend):
   - `mkdir backend && cd backend`
   - `npm init -y`
   - `npm install express cors body-parser firebase-admin`
   - Create `index.js` with endpoints `POST /api/match` and `POST /api/report`.
5. Local run commands:
   - Frontend dev: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
   - Backend dev: `cd backend && node index.js`
6. Build & Deploy:
   - Frontend build: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Deploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod` OR Firebase hosting:
     - `firebase login`
     - `firebase init hosting functions` (follow prompts)
     - `npm run build` then `firebase deploy --only hosting`
7. CI: create GitHub Actions workflow `infra/deploy.yml` that runs `npm ci`, `npm run build` and triggers Vercel/Firebase deploy on push to main.

TESTING & QA
- Add a smoke test script to assert the frontend loads and `/api/match` returns expected JSON for a sample payload.
- Create `demo_fallback.mp4` inside frontend/public and ensure it plays.

OUTPUTS I expect you to produce in the repo:
1. Full source code for frontend and backend.
2. `README.md` with local run and deploy instructions + how to set environment variables and GitHub Secrets.
3. `infra/deploy.yml` for GitHub Actions.
4. A demo URL after successful deploy OR explicit deploy instructions if Flames cannot deploy itself.
5. A zip download link or GitHub repo URL containing the final project.

PLEASE: After generating files, run linters and build commands, capture the build logs, and include them in a file `BUILD_LOGS.txt`. If any errors occur, fix them and re-run until the build completes successfully.

EXTRA: Use the uploaded design brief at `/mnt/data/DreamWave Abstract.pdf` to fill README, about page content, and to name the project.

If anything is unclear, make a best-effort decision (prefer simplicity and clarity), implement it, and explain your assumption in README.

Deliver the GitHub repo URL or a zipped archive of the repo. Also provide the exact commands I must run locally to test and to deploy, and the exact values to put into GitHub Secrets for deployment (names and descriptions). Thank you.
